        <h2>Game Overview</h2>
        <p>Introduction to Cricket
            Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field centered around a 22-yard pitch with wickets at each end. Originating in 16th century England, cricket has grown into a global sport, particularly popular in countries like England, Australia, India, Pakistan, South Africa, and the West Indies.
            
            History of Cricket
            Cricket began as a children's game in southeast England, with the first recorded match in 1697. It evolved over the centuries, with the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) founded in 1787, establishing the game's rules. The first international match took place in 1844, and the first Test match was played in 1877 between England and Australia.
            
            Basic Rules and Gameplay
            Objective:
            
            The main goal is to score more runs than the opposing team.
            Teams and Roles:
            
            Each team has eleven players: batsmen, bowlers, wicketkeepers, and all-rounders.
            Field and Equipment:
            
            Played on an oval field with a central 22-yard pitch.
            Each end of the pitch has a wicket with three stumps and two bails.
            Innings and Overs:
            
            Matches consist of one or two innings per team.
            An inning ends when ten batsmen are out or a set number of overs have been bowled.
            Batting:
            
            Batsmen score runs by hitting the ball and running between the wickets or hitting boundaries (four runs for a boundary hit, six runs for a ball hit over the boundary on the full).
            Bowling and Fielding:
            
            Bowlers deliver six-ball overs aiming to dismiss batsmen by hitting the stumps, catching, LBW, or other methods.
            Fielders are strategically placed to prevent runs and take catches.
            Formats:
            
            Test Cricket: Played over five days, two innings per team.
            One Day Internationals (ODIs): Each team faces 50 overs.
            Twenty20 (T20) Cricket: Each team faces 20 overs, promoting fast-paced play.
            Cricket combines strategy, skill, and endurance, making it a beloved sport with a rich tradition worldwide.</p>
